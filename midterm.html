<h1><i>The Life of Pablo</i></h1>

<p><strong><i>The Life of Pablo</i></strong> is the seventh studio album by American rapper and recording artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West" target="_blank">Kanye West</a>, released on February 14, 2016 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOOD_Music" target="_blank">GOOD Music</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam_Recordings" target="_blank">Def Jam Recordings</a>.[6] Recording sessions took place from 2013 to 2016 in Italy, Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Production on the album was handled by West and a variety of producers, including co-executive producers Rick Rubin and Noah Goldstein, Mike Dean, Metro Boomin, Hudson Mohawke, Plain Pat, and Madlib. He also enlisted a wide array of guest vocalists, including The Weeknd, Ty Dolla Sign, Desiigner, Kid Cudi, The-Dream, Chance the Rapper, Rihanna, Frank Ocean, Sampha, Post Malone, Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug, and Caroline Shaw.</p>

<p>The album was preceded by several promotional singles as part of West's GOOD Fridays giveaways, including the tracks "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in LA".[7] In the months before its release, the album's title and tracklist went through several publicized changes, and West's erratic activity on social media became the source of several controversies.[8][9] An early version of the album was premiered by West at Madison Square Garden on February 11, 2016, as part of his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show in collaboration with Adidas.[10] After several additional sessions and alterations, the album was launched exclusively through the streaming service Tidal three days later.[11]</p>

<p><i>The Life of Pablo</i> received positive reviews from critics, with particular attention drawn to the fragmented, unfinished nature of its composition and release. Following Tidal's disclosure of its streaming data and the album's release to competing streaming services, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming West's <u>seventh consecutive number-one album</u> on the chart and the first to reach the summit primarily through streaming. In April 2017, <i>The Life of Pablo</i> became the first streaming-only album to go platinum, becoming West's eighth platinum-certified release.[15] It was named among the best albums of 2016 by multiple publications, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, while "Ultralight Beam" and "Famous" were nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song.</p>

<h1 class="header" id="anchor1">Background</h1>

<p>In November 2013, West began working on his eighth album, under the working title <i>So Help Me God</i> for a 2014 release date. The album was initially to include production work by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. Early recording sessions resulted in several tracks that were released as standalone singles or were given to other artists, including his Paul McCartney collaborations "All Day", "Only One", and the McCartney and Rihanna collaboration "FourFiveSeconds". Some of the earlier tracks to make the final cut for <i>The Life of Pablo</i> were "Famous" (formerly titled "Nina Chop") and "Wolves", the latter of which West performed on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>'s 40th anniversary episode with Australian recording artist Sia and fellow rapper Vic Mensa. In 2015, West announced the new album title <i>SWISH</i>, though he clarified that this could still be subject to change. West announced in January 2016 that <i>SWISH</i> would be released on February 11, and that month released new songs "Real Friends" and a snippet of "No More Parties in L.A." with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which West releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from <i>SWISH</i> to <i>Waves</i>.</p>

<p>Several days ahead of its release, West again changed the title, this time to <i>The Life of Pablo</i>. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track "Waves" at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016 following a performance on SNL. Following its official streaming release, West continued to tinker with mixes of several tracks, describing the work as "a living breathing changing creative expression" and proclaiming the end of the album as a dominant release form. Although a statement by West around <i>Life of Pablo's</i> initial release indicated that the album would be a permanent exclusive to Tidal, the album was released through several other competing services starting in April.</p>

<h1 class="header" id="anchor2">Critical reception</h1>

<p><i>The Life of Pablo</i> received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 35 reviews. <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s Rob Sheffield dubbed it both a mess and masterpiece: "This is a messy album that feels like it was made that way on purpose [...] West just drops broken pieces of his psyche all over the album and challenges you to fit them together." The A.V. Club's Corbin Reiff opined that "it feels far different from any of the tightly constructed, singular works of West's past", asserting instead that "as a beautiful, messy, mixed-up collection of 18 songs, it's a brilliant document." Writing for The New York Times, Jon Caramanica stated, "West [...] has perfected the art of aesthetic and intellectual bricolage, shape-shifting in real time and counting on listeners to keep up", concluding that "this is Tumblr-as-album, the piecing together of divergent fragments to make a cohesive whole." In a positive review, Jayson Greene of Pitchfork wrote that "a madcap sense of humor animates all [West's] best work, and <i>The Life of Pablo</i> has a freewheeling energy that is infectious and unique to his discography", finding that "somehow, it comes off as both his most labored-over and unfinished album, full of asterisks and corrections and footnotes." Robert Christgau for Vice found the record "wittingly casual and easy on the ears", writing that, "unlike Yeezus, it won't top many 2016 listsâ€”it's too blatantly imperfect, too flagrantly unfocused. But that's also its charm, and I prefer it."</p>
